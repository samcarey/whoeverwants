# Ranked Choice "No Preference" Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a new "No Preference" area in the ranked choice voting interface that allows users to drag items out of the main ranking list. Items in the "No Preference" area will not be counted in the ballot submission or voting calculations.

## Core Requirements

### 1. User Interface Changes
- **Main Ranking List**: Existing drag-and-drop functionality remains unchanged
- **No Preference Area**: New secondary area below the main list
  - Visual separation from main list (different styling/border)
  - Clear labeling: "No Preference" or similar
  - Support for drag-and-drop operations

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Behavior
- **From Main to No Preference**: Items can be dragged from main list to No Preference area
- **From No Preference to Main**: Items can be dragged back to main list at any position
- **Within No Preference**: Items can be rearranged among themselves using same logic as main list
- **Main List Reordering**: When item removed, remaining items maintain their relative order (no gaps)

### 3. Ballot Submission Logic
- **Only Main List Counts**: Only items in the main ranking list are included in submitted ballot
- **No Preference Ignored**: Items in No Preference area are completely excluded from voting data
- **Validation**: Ensure at least one item remains in main list for valid submission

### 4. Voting Algorithm Updates

#### Ranked Choice Voting (IRV)
- **Ballot Elimination Rule**: If all candidates on a voter's ballot are eliminated in previous rounds:
  - Remove that ballot from consideration entirely
  - Do not transfer to any remaining candidates
  - Update vote totals accordingly

#### Borda Count System
- **Point Compensation**: Ballots with fewer than maximum candidates need adjusted scoring:
  - Calculate points based on actual number of ranked candidates
  - Ensure fair comparison between ballots with different numbers of candidates
  - Formula: Adjust point values so each ballot contributes equally to final scoring

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: UI Components
1. **Modify Ranked Choice Component**
   - Add No Preference drop zone below main list
   - Update drag-and-drop handlers to support two zones
   - Implement visual feedback for valid drop targets

2. **Update State Management**
   - Separate state for main list and no preference list
   - Update drag handlers to move items between lists
   - Maintain proper indexing for both lists

3. **Styling Updates**
   - Distinct visual styling for No Preference area
   - Clear visual separation between areas
   - Consistent drag-and-drop feedback

#### Phase 1 Testing Plan

**1. Component Rendering Tests**
```javascript
// Test cases to implement
- Render with empty main and no preference lists
- Render with items only in main list (5, 10, 20 items)
- Render with items only in no preference list
- Render with items in both lists (various distributions)
- Verify proper CSS classes and styling applied
- Verify labels and instructions are visible and correct
- Test component cleanup and memory leaks
```

**2. Drag-and-Drop Interaction Tests**
```javascript
// Critical test scenarios
- Drag single item from main to no preference (first, middle, last position)
- Drag single item from no preference to main (various target positions)
- Drag within main list (reordering functionality preserved)
- Drag within no preference list (same logic as main list)
- Attempt invalid drags (outside drop zones, non-draggable elements)
- Visual feedback during drag operations (hover states, drop indicators)
- Cancel drag operations (ESC key, drag outside valid zones)
- Rapid successive drag operations (stress test)
- Simultaneous multi-user drag operations (if applicable)
```

**3. State Management Tests**

- Test IRV with mixed complete and incomplete ballots
- Test ballot elimination when all ranked candidates eliminated
- Verify vote transfers skip eliminated ballots correctly
- Test multiple elimination rounds with incomplete ballots

Candidates: A, B, C, D
Ballot 1: [A, B] (incomplete - missing C, D)
Ballot 2: [B, C, D] (complete)
Ballot 3: [C, D] (incomplete - missing A, B)
Round 1: Eliminate D (lowest votes)
Round 2: Eliminate C - Ballot 3 now has no valid candidates, remove from consideration
Round 3: Continue with Ballots 1 and 2 only

Test Case 2: "All Candidates Eliminated"
Ballot: [A, B] where both A and B are eliminated in early rounds
Expected: Ballot removed from all subsequent rounds

Test Case 3: "Single Candidate Ballots"
Multiple ballots with only one candidate ranked
Verify proper handling when that candidate is eliminated
```

**2. Borda Count Compensation Algorithm Tests**

- Verify total points consistency across different scenarios

// Compensation Formula Testing:
Standard Borda: n candidates, points = n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0
Incomplete Ballot: k candidates ranked (k < n)
Compensation: Scale points so each ballot contributes equally

Test Case 1: "Equal Contribution Verification"
5 candidates total: A, B, C, D, E
Complete ballot [A, B, C, D, E]: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, E=0 (sum=10)
Incomplete ballot [A, B, C]: Need compensation to sum=10
Adjusted points: A=5, B=3.33, C=1.67 (sum=10)

Test Case 2: "Mixed Ballot Lengths"
Verify consistent winner across different ballot completion rates
Test edge case: single candidate ballots
Test edge case: all candidates except one ranked

Test Case 3: "Mathematical Properties"
Monotonicity: Adding a vote for candidate X shouldn't decrease X's rank
Independence: Removing non-winning candidate shouldn't change winner
Condorcet criterion: If candidate beats all others pairwise, should win
