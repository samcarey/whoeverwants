## What is this?

Whoever Wants is a lightweight, anonymous polling app that helps groups make decisions together. Whether you're deciding where to eat, what movie to watch, or any other group decision - this tool makes it easy to collect everyone's preferences without the hassle of accounts or sign-ups.

## Features

- **No accounts required** - Create and vote on polls completely anonymously
- **Yes/No polls** - Simple binary decisions
- **Ranked choice voting** - For when you have multiple options and want to find the best consensus
- **Time-limited polls** - Set deadlines to keep decisions moving
- **Share via link** - Just send the URL to collect responses
- **Mobile optimized** - Works great on any device

## About the Code

This app is mostly vibe coded - built with intuition and iteration rather than rigid planning. It's a Next.js app with Supabase for the backend, but the real magic is in keeping things simple and functional.

**Latest Updates**: Fixed React 19 compatibility issues and restored poll list functionality (August 2024).
